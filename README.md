# MetroFrameworkExtended
An extended version of MetroFramework which added bunch of UI and design

This is a project which extends [MetroFramework](https://github.com/thielj/MetroFramework) which already 8 years not updating

## Added Components:
* MaskedTextBox
* Multicolumn Combobox (Actually is just showing a MetroGrid under a combobox, pretty ugly)
* Captcha Picturebox (Generates random style numbers for user to verify captcha)
* Fixed Picturebox (A picturebox that almost like html object-fit, but it having black spaces to make image fixed inside)
* Base64 Support Picturebox (Decode Base64 string into a picturebox)
* Vertical Tab (Based on original MetroTab, but vertical version)
* Hidden Value Combobox (A combobox which shows text and returns value differently, good in some situation)
* MetroBarchart (Based on System.Windows.Forms.DataVisualization)

> All components are mostly using third-party extensions, hence all credits are among them.This is only a garbage small extension. Anyone who is god are welcome to improve this shit!
